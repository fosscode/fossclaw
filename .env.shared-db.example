# Example: Share session database between fossclaw and fossclaw-stable
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to .env in both fossclaw/ and fossclaw-stable/
#   2. Both instances will read/write to the same session storage
#   3. Use different PORTs to run them simultaneously

# Different ports for each instance
PORT=3456          # fossclaw uses 3456
# PORT=3457        # fossclaw-stable would use 3457

# Shared session directory (absolute path recommended)
FOSSCLAW_SESSION_DIR=/Users/dev/.fossclaw/sessions

# Optional: default working directory
# FOSSCLAW_CWD=/Users/dev/code

# Optional: Basic auth (enable on both or neither)
# FOSSCLAW_USER=admin
# FOSSCLAW_PASS=secret

# Optional: Linear integration
# LINEAR_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Optional: OpenCode bridge port
# OPENCODE_PORT=3556
